# Mini Projects in Data Visualization

Welcome to the `mini projects` folder in the Data Visualization repo! This directory showcases a selection of compact, yet insightful data visualization projects that touch on a variety of interesting topics and datasets. Dive in to explore the visual stories these projects tell.

## Projects Included:

### 1. CODAP Challenge
**Description**: Dive deep into the CODAP dataset, revealing patterns, insights, and telling a visual story based on the data points present. This challenge showcases not only the ability to visualize, but also the capability to derive meaningful conclusions from the dataset.

### 2. HotDogs Graph Challenge
**Description**: A quirky and fun visualization exercise that explores the world of hotdogs! Using a unique dataset, this project visualizes various attributes of hotdogs and offers an unconventional perspective on this beloved snack.

### 3. NHANES Graph Challenge
**Description**: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset is a rich reservoir of health and nutrition data. This visualization challenge delves into this dataset to extract and present the most compelling stories related to public health and nutrition patterns.

### 4. OwidCOVID Visualization
**Description**: In these tumultuous times, understanding the spread and impact of COVID-19 is paramount. Using the 'Our World in Data' COVID-19 dataset, this project visualizes the progression, impact, and various facets of the pandemic.

### 5. Transformation Exe i
**Description**: This visualization focuses on the concept of data transformation. Through a series of exercises, it demonstrates the power of data transformation in refining and elevating visual narratives.

## Getting Started:

1. **Prerequisites**: 
   - Make sure you have `R` and `RStudio` installed on your machine.
   - Some projects might require additional R packages. Commonly used packages for data visualization in R include `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, and `dplyr`. Ensure they are installed or refer to the project-specific README for a list of required packages.
   
2. Each project has its own folder, which includes the dataset (if not linked externally), an R script or R Markdown file with the visualization code, and any supplementary materials.

3. Navigate to a project folder of interest and open the corresponding R script or R Markdown file in `RStudio` to view and run the visualization.

> Remember, if you're new to R, the `install.packages("package_name")` function can be used to install any required package.
