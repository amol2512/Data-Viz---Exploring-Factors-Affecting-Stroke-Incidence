# **Hotdogs Graph Challenge: Visualizing Hotdog Consumption with R**

Welcome to the Hotdogs Graph Challenge! In this challenge, we'll be working with a dataset that captures hotdog consumption details, and our goal is to visualize the insights using R. This README will guide you on how to understand, approach, and visualize the dataset.

## **Prerequisites**

1. **R**: Make sure you have R installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

2. **RStudio** (optional): This is an integrated development environment for R. You can download it [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

3. **Required Libraries**:
   ```R
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   install.packages("dplyr")

## **Dataset**

Date: The date when the hotdogs were consumed.

NumberConsumed: The number of hotdogs consumed on that date.

Location: The location where the hotdogs were consumed.


## **Challenge Objectives**:
Basic Visualization: Plot the number of hotdogs consumed over time.

Location-based Insights: Visualize the total hotdogs consumed per location.

Monthly Consumption: Group data monthly and visualize monthly hotdog consumption trends.
