Hotdogs Graph Challenge: Visualizing Hotdog Consumption with R
Welcome to the Hotdogs Graph Challenge! In this challenge, we'll be working with a dataset that captures hotdog consumption details, and our goal is to visualize the insights using R. This README will guide you on how to understand, approach, and visualize the dataset.

Prerequisites
R: Make sure you have R installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from here.

RStudio (optional): This is an integrated development environment for R. You can download it here.

Required Libraries:

R
Copy code
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
Dataset
The dataset, hotdogs.csv, contains the following columns:

Date: The date when the hotdogs were consumed.
NumberConsumed: The number of hotdogs consumed on that date.
Location: The location where the hotdogs were consumed.
Challenge Objectives:
Basic Visualization: Plot the number of hotdogs consumed over time.
Location-based Insights: Visualize the total hotdogs consumed for the United States.
Monthly Consumption: Group data monthly and visualize monthly hotdog consumption trends.
